  <h1>Michael Kennedy is one of Irelands leading ceramic artists</h1>
</br>
  <p>His work is unique, original, and evokes all that is west of Ireland. From the motive energy of the Atlantic, to the 
delicate colours and forms of our wild flowers, from the ancient structures or our stone walls, to the rawness of the 
bogland.</p> 
<p>In colours, in shapes, in design, he reflects all of this. Each and every piece is hand-thrown on the pottersâ€™ 
wheel. Layers of texture, markings and slips are applied, covering the piece in a maze of intricate patters and colour.</p>

<p>The sculpted work is further modelled to create a unique art-object. Layers of glaze are copiously applied which,after 
firing, reflect the strong tones and shades of the Irish countryside, giving each piece richnessand depth of colour. The
final forms are vested with the skill and artistry of the master Craftsman.</p>

<p>As Michael Kennedy Pottery is hand-made the Glaze, etc. will 
vary. If you are adding to some items of Michael Kennedy Pottery 
that you already have, we can provide you with photos and 
dimensions for your approval before we ship them.</p>
